# 🌙 ShadowStrike
### A Haunted Archery Arcade Game built with C++ & OpenGL

ShadowStrike is a **2D archery-based shooting game** developed using **C++ and OpenGL (GLUT)** as part of a Computer Graphics mini-project.  

Set inside a spooky graveyard environment, the player controls an archer who must aim and shoot arrows at different types of moving targets while managing limited resources and maximizing score.

Unlike fast-paced combat games, **ShadowStrike focuses on precision, timing, and control**, making gameplay skill-based and highly engaging.
